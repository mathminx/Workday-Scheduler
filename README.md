## Description

This is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. It was created by modifying starter code. The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

When the user opens the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. Below the date are one-hour time blocks for every hour of the day between 08:00 and 20:00 (8am to 8pm, with the last block being for 7pm). Each time block is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. The user can click into any time block, enter an event, and save it to local storage. When the page is refreshed, the saved events persist.
